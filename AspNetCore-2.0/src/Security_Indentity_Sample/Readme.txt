In Visual Studio, you can use the Package Manager Console to apply pending migrations to the database:

1. Select default project 'Security_Indentity_Sample' in package manager console on top

PM> Update-Database

Alternatively, you can apply pending migrations from a command prompt at your project directory:

> dotnet ef database update
